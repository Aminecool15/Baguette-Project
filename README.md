This Python program allows you to generate random passwords of a custom length. It uses the random library to select random characters from the predefined strings string.ascii_letters, string.digits and string.punctuation.



The user can choose the length of the password and decide to use it by pressing the 'F' key. The program displays a stylized title with the colorama library, and the user has two options: generate a password or quit the program.



This program is ideal for generating strong, secure passwords without having to worry about creating them yourself. It is easy to use and can be customized according to the user's needs.
